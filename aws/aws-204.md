# **AWS-204**

This course covers a deeper dive of AWS IAM, including Assume Roles, Policies and Statement Components, and more in-depth examples.  While this course covers some basic concepts, it will be primarily focused on Service to Service interaction for least privileged access.

# Topics

* Approaching IAM
* Assume Roles
* Policies and Statement Components

# How to Approach IAM

Draw the resources in your applicaiton.  Decide what actions they need to take against the resource downstream in the workflow.
  
---

# Assume Roles

The Role must trust the target service to assume the role. To do this, the Role must be granted that permission via the following trust policy.

```Terraform
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "policy" {
  version = "2012-10-17"
  statement {
    actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]
    effect  = "Allow"
    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["apigateway.amazonaws.com"]
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "api_gateway_role" {
  name                 = "my_role"
  permissions_boundary = "arn:aws:iam::0123456789:policy/CloudCoreL3Permissions"
  assume_role_policy   = data.aws_iam_policy_document.policy.json
}
```
