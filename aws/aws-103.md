# **AWS-103**

This course covers some common serverless technologies (FaaS) that are available for use in AWS, such as Lambda, SxS, RDS, s3, API Gateway, and related ops/management/cost burdens.

---

# Topics

* Serverless (FaaS)
* Why use FaaS
* When to use FaaS
* Serverless Resources

# Serverless (FaaS)

Function as a service (FaaS) is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage application functionalities without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.

---

# Why use FaaS

* Dynamic Scaling
* Low delivery time
* Faster Deployments
* Low Management Overhead
* Cost Optimized
* NO PATCHING
  
---

# When to use FaaS

* Each invocation of your application is stateless
* Services that are event-driven that need horizontal scaling
* When persistent connections are **NOT** required

---

# When NOT to use FaaS

* An application that performs a lot of initialization (or re-initialization)
* Long Running Jobs (AWS Lambda has a limit on execution time of 15 mins)
* Large Application Archive/Binary Size

---

# How to Make It work

* Use fast-loading, modern, programming languages (NodeJS, Python, Golang)
* Refactor your application to work with Queueing technologies
* Refactor the many parts of the appliation into smaller functions

# Serverless Resources

There are many services for handling the requests for and/or the manipulation of data for your application.  The next few slides are common resources, and are not comprehensive.

---

# Lambda

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.  It is the simpliest form of compute resources.

[Supported Lambda Runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html)

---

# SQS / SNS / SMS

These are serverless resources for handing different areas of moving data around.

* Simple Queue Service
* Simple Notification Service
* Simple Mail Service

---

# RDS

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.  It is the simpliest form of compute resources.

---

# S3

An object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

---

# API Gateway

A fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.

---

# Common Patterns

The following slides demostrate some common patterns to implement serverless technologies into usable patterns.
