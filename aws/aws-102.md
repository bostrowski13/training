# Environment + Branch Matrix

The pipeline currently deploys in response to changes on the following branches:

| Account           | Branch         | Workspace                          |
|---                |---             |---                                 |
| `innovation`      | `feature/*`    | `dev-feature-*`                    |
| `innovation`      | `PR-*`         | `dev-pr-*`                         |
| `innovation`      | `develop`      | `dev`                              |
| `non-production`  | `release/*`    | `qa-release-*` and `cap-release-*` |
| `non-production`  | `hotfix/*`     | `qa-hotfix-*` and `cap-hotfix-*`   |
