# **AWS-104**

This course covers an overview of AWS KMS and IAM, including the components of IAM, and some best practices.  While this course covers some basic concepts, it will be primarily focused on Service to Service interaction for least privileged access.

# Topics

* Overview
* KMS
* IAM
* Components of an IAM Role
* Best Practices
* Example of Service to Service Interaction

---

# Overview

Because IAM is an expansive topic, for the purposes of this course, we'll be focusing on the basics of IAM with a particular focus on service to service interaction.

# KMS

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control customer master keys (CMKs), the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.

---

# When to Use KMS

* Always
* All the time
* For any service that holds or transports data (Hint:  All do)
* IPRM Mandates that Customer Managed Keys must be used whenever available

---

# How to Use KMS CMKs

```Terraform
resource "aws_kms_key" "encryption" {
  description              = "KMS Key for my_app"
  deletion_window_in_days  = 14
  tags                     = var.tags
}

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "keyvalue" {
  name = "my_db"
  ...other configs

  server_side_encryption {
    enabled     = true
    kms_key_arn = aws_kms_key.encryption.arn
  }
}
```

# IAM

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources, including their interaction as part of a workflow of your application.

---

# Components of an IAM Role

![height:500](content/iam_building_blocks.jpg)

---

# Role

An IAM role is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. IAM roles are not associated with a specific user or group. Instead, trusted entities assume roles, such as IAM users, applications, or AWS services.

---

# Policy and Statement

* Policy - A policy is an entity that, when attached to an identity or resource, defines their permissions.
* Statement - A statement is the actual definition of the permissions in a policy.

---

# Building a Role

At a very basic level...

1. Allow the Service to Assume a Role
2. Create a Role for the Resource
3. Create a policy with 1 to Many Statements
4. Associate Policy with Resource Role
5. Associate Resource Role with Resource

---

# Best Practices

* IAM policies should **always** use least privileged access
* No "*" (ANY) Statements/Actions/Principals
* Use Conditions to mitigate or add additional security to Roles

---

# A Bad Policy

```Terraform
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "bad_news_bears" {
  version = "2012-10-17"
  statement {
    sid     = "IDoWhatIWantToSQS"
    actions = ["sqs:*"]
    effect  = "Allow"
    resources = ["*"]
  }
}
```

---

# What Makes it Bad

* "*" statement on resources paramter
* "*" on actions paramter for SQS
* No Conditions

---

# A Good Policy

```Terraform
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "much_better" {
  version = "2012-10-17"
  statement {
    sid     = "AllowLambdaToSendMessagesToSqsQueues"
    actions = ["sqs:SendMessage"]
    effect  = "Allow"
    resources = [
      aws_lambda_function.send_message_lambda_example.arn
    ]
  }
}
```

---

# What Makes It Good

Specifies the specific:
* Actions on the resource (sqs:SendMessage)
* Resource that is the target to communicate with (ARN of the resource)

---

# Good Policy with Conditions

```Terraform
  statement {
    sid    = "ReadFromApigeeIps"
    principals {
      type        = "*"
      identifiers = ["*"]
    }
    actions   = ["execute-api:Invoke"]
    resources = ["execute-api:/my_api/*"]
    condition {
      test     = "StringLike"
      variable = "aws:SourceIp"
      values   = ["192.168.0.5", "192.168.0.10"]
    }
  }
```

---

# What Makes It Good (Condition)

* Specifies the specific actions on the resource (execute-api:Invoke)
* Resource that is the target to communicate with (name of the API)
* While the pricipals are ANY (*), its limited by the conditions
