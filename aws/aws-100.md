# **AWS-100**

This course covers a basic introduction to Cloud concepts and a brief introduction to the paradeigm shift that is needed to be successful.

---

# Topics

* Cloud Pricipals
* Paradeigm Shift
* Expectations

---

# Cloud Principals

* Operational Excellence
* Security
* Reliability
* Performance Efficiency
* Cost Optimization

---

# Operational Excellence

There are five design principles for operational excellence in the cloud:

* Perform operations as code
* Make frequent, small, reversible changes
* Refine operations procedures frequently
* Anticipate failure
* Learn from all operational failures

---

# Security

There are seven design principles for security in the cloud:

* Implement a strong identity foundation
* Enable traceability
* Apply security at all layers
* Automate security best practices
* Protect data in transit and at rest
* Keep people away from data
* Prepare for security events

---

# Reliability

There are five design principles for reliability in the cloud:

* Automatically recover from failure
* Test recovery procedures
* Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
* Stop guessing capacity
* Manage change in automation

---

# Performance Efficiency

There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:

* Democratize advanced technologies
* Go global in minutes
* Use serverless architectures
* Experiment more often
* Consider mechanical sympathy

---

# Cost Optimization

There are five design principles for cost optimization in the cloud:

* Implement cloud financial management
* Adopt a consumption model
* Measure overall efficiency
* Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
* Analyze and attribute expenditure

---

# Paradeigm Shift

* Determine what policies and procedures are necessary, remove any that provide no value, automate what does.

* Automate communication

* Standardize on well-adopted open source principals

* Work towards Continuous Delivery

# Don't Panic

I want to Cloud good, but this is a lot...

# Available Resources

* Infrastructure Modules
* Architecture and Application Patterns
* Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
* Training (Internal and External)
* CI/CD Pipelines that Help Deliver Code through the SDLC

---

## Don'ts

* Lift-and-shift
* Build/Design for the edge case
* Reinvent the Wheel

---

# Do

* Avoid Antipatterns
* Be agile (Iteration is encouraged)
* Be as cloud native as possible (FaaS > CaaS > PaaS > IaaS)

---

# Why to Refactor

## Hidden Costs

While the cost to refactor applications may take additional time and expense up front, the long term cost of running and maintaining IaaS  (traditional infrastructure) will be greater over time.

* Application Deployments
* Vendor Support

---

# Other Benefits

* Features get delivered faster to meet business needs
* Developers are more motivated and feel more accomplished
* Constant Testing to find Issues Earlier
* Environmental Consistency
* Prevent Environment Sprawl
