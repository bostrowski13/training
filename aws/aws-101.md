# Innovation Account

* Used as a learning space that allows use of GUI
* Automatically cleaned up after 30 days
* Entire applicaiton must be codified before moving on to the Non-Prod Account
* Contains Dev environment

# Non-Proudction Account

* Limited to No GUI access for most Roles
* Used to host stable, long-lived integration environments (QA and CAP)
* More locked down than Innovation account

---

# Production Account

* Locked down across almost all Roles for additional security (except where support is needed)
* Hosts the PSP and Production environments
*

# Account Layers

* They provide certain funcitonality at each level
