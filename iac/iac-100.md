# **IAC-100**

This course covers a basic introduction to Infrastructure as Code codcepts and their benefits.

---

# Topics

* What is IaC?
* Benefits
* How it fits into DevOps
* Example
* Resources

---

# What is IaC?

* Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning infrastructure and components through machine-readable definition files and/or APIs, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

---

# Benefits

* Environment Consistency
* Less Downtime
* Less Accidental Misconfiguration
* Increased Security
* Speed of delivery
* Lower Cost

---

# How it fits into DevOps

IaC is a key attribute of enabling best practices in DevOps â€“ Developers become more involved in defining the configuration of intrastructure configuration and Ops teams get involved earlier in the development process.

---

# How does it work?

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an option for this purpose.  You can define the infrastructure configuration with their easy to use coding language, called HCL.

* This tool is used as the IaC tool for AWS, Apigee, and a few services.

---

# Example 1

```Terraform
resource "aws_iam_role" "iam_for_lambda" {
  name   = "iam_for_lambda"
  policy = # policy with least privileged access
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "export_lambda" {
  filename      = "my_function.zip"
  function_name = "export_data-${terraform.workspace}"
  role          = aws_iam_role.iam_for_lambda.arn
  handler       = "exports.test"
  runtime       = "nodejs12.1"
}
```

---

# Example 1 Benefits

* Least privileged access
* Easy to undersatnd
* Will define consistnt infrastructure

---

# Example 2

```Terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket-${terraform.workspace}"
  acl    = "private"
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.mykey.arn
        sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Example 2 Benefits

* Easy to undersatnd
* Defines consistnt infrastructure
* Easily Implements Security practices (Encryption at Rest, Non-Public)
* Keeps versions of objects stored, easy to retrive
