# **IAC-101**

This course covers a basic introduction to Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code tool.

---

# Topics

* What is Terraform?
* Vocab
* Anatomy of a Terraform Project
* Understanding State
* Providers
* Backend
* Names and Tags
* Simple Workflow
* A few other Useful Commands

---

# What is Terraform?

* Terraform is a config as code tool by HashiCorp
* Terraform the tool is written in Golang
* Terraform code is written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) which looks a lot like json and ends in the .tf extension
* Its declarative (you specify what you want not how to get to your desired state)

---

# Vocab 1

* Provider – a plugin that allows terraform to interact with other systems (e.g. AWS, the local file system, apigee…)
* Resource – an instance of a resource provided by a provider (e.g. aws_lambda_function, local_file, template_file…)
* Data source – a way to lookup data from a provider
* Module – a self contained set of terraform that is intended to be reused

---

# Vocab 2

* Variable – a value passed to terraform
* Output – a value exported from a module or the main.tf so it can be referenced elsewhere
* State file – where terraform stores what it knows about the current state of all resources
* Workspace - a namespace that gets its own state file

---

# Anatomy of a Project

There are a few standard naming conventions to be aware of:

* main.tf – the entry point of the project
* variables.tf – where all the inputs of a terraform project or module are defined
* outputs.tf – where the outputs of a terraform project or module are defined
* versions.tf – where we define the versions of the providers to use and the version of terraform itself

---

# Anatomy of a Project (con't)

* backend.tf - defines where the terraform state file is stored and optionally what kind of locking mechanism we are using to prevent concurrent writes to the state file. Sometimes people put provider versions here instead of versions.tf
* terraform.tfvars – optional file has values that will be passed to the module as variables (variables can also be passed on the cli)

---

# Understanding State

* State files can be stored locally or remotely
* We store all our state files in an S3 bucket in each account
* Each Terraform workspace gets its own state file
* To prevent concurrent writes to a state file we use a DynamoDB table to lock the state file when performing potentially mutative operations
* The outputs of one state file can be referenced by another
* Terraform considers the state file to be the source of truth and many errors are caused when resources are manually edited outside of terraform causing state drift

---

# Providers

* Providers are responsible for providing the resources in Terraform for managing the lifecycle of a resource: create, read, update, delete.
* We use several (AWS, Apigee, Launch Darkly), but dozens are available.
* Supported providers are preferred

---

# Backend

* A "backend" in Terraform determines how/where state is loaded and how an operation such as apply is executed.
* This abstraction enables non-local file state storage, remote execution, etc for multiple workloads.

---

# Nanes and Tags

* All resources must have unique neames
* Resource name characeter restrictions are based on the provider and resource within that provider
* All resources that are capabile of using Tags should
* Use standard names and tags

---

# Simple Workflow

The following are commands that facilitate the deployment of resources using Terraform code.

1. Init
2. Plan
3. Apply
4. Destroy

---

# Init

* The terraform init command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
* It fetches providers and modules used in the project

---

# Plan

* The terraform plan command is used to create an execution plan.
* Terraform performs a refresh, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files against the current state.
* It provides a preview for the changes it will make.

---

# Apply

* The terraform apply command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.
* It does not automically rollback changes on failure

---

# Destroy

* The terraform destroy command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.
* Makes cleanup simple for short-lived environments.

---

# Format

* The terraform fmt command is used to rewrite Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style. 
* This command applies a subset of the Terraform language style conventions, along with other minor adjustments for readability.

---

# Validate

* The terraform validate command validates the configuration files in a directory are **syntatically** correct
* They refer only to the configuration of the HCL and do not access any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs, etc to validate parameters.

---

# Finding Help

* For announcements related to new Features related to the public cloud, join the #cloud channel in Slack.
* For issues experienced during deployment, consult your team lead or teammate for first-level support
* If the issue cannot be solved by first consulting the resources above, contact an SME in the #publiccloudsupport channel in Slack.
