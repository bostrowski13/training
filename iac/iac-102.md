# **IAC-102**

This course covers more advanced topics of Terraform, including a deeper look at the Terraform Workflow, Workspaces, and Inputs and Outputs.

---

# Topics

* Terraform Core Workflow
* Workspaces
* Variables
* Outputs

---

# Terraform Core Workflow

1. Write some Terraform code.

2. Run `terraform init` in the same directory as the *.tf file(s) to pull in all required plugins and modules, as well as connect to the backend.

3. Create/Select your workspace using `terraform workspace new` and/or `terraform workspace select`

---

# Terraform Core Workflow (con't)

4. Next you will want to run a `terraform plan` to see what terraform things needs to change

5. Evaluate your plan.

6. If the plan looks good you can run `terraform apply` to apply your changes.

7. If you need to tear down your infrastructure you can run a `terraform destroy`

---

# Workspaces

* Workspaces are Collections of Infrastructure
* Workspaces are logical ways to separate environment state files.
* Workspaces create a separate state file for that named workspace
* They allow for the same exact code to be run on any workspace (e.g. Dev, QA, CAP, PSP, Prod) with minimal, environment specific changes.

---

# Variables

* Input variables serve as parameters for a Terraform project
* Allow aspects of the project to be customized without altering the module's own source code (minor environment changes)
* Have support for simple and complex types
* Can have defaults for simplier implementation
* Can be overriden to provide additional customization

---

# Simple Variable Type Examples

```Terraform
variable "name" {
  description = "A name value for naming created resources"
  type        = string
}

variable "tags" {
  description = "A map of tags for tagging created resources"
  type        = map
}

variable "keyvalue" {
  description = "A flag that specifies whether to create storage for key-value data (a DynamoDB Table)"
  type        = bool
}
```

```Bash
terraform plan -var="keyvalue=true" -var="writers=[us, them]"
```

---

# Complex Variable Type Examples

```Terraform
variable "dynamodb_attributes" {
  description = "Additional DynamoDB attributes in the form of a list of mapped values"
  type = list(object({
    name = string
    type = string
  }))
  default = []
}

variable "writers" {
  description = "A list of roles that should be allowed to write to encrypted data resources"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = []
}
```

---

# tfvars

* These are variable definitions files
* They can either be specified on the command line or automatically loaded (via *.tfvars files)
* Can contain definitions for any variable type

---

# tfvars examples

```Terraform
rds_engine         = "aurora"
rds_engine_mode    = "serverless"
rds_engine_version = "5.6.10a"
backup_retention_period = {
  default = 1
  dev     = 7
  prod    = 30
}
```

---

# tfvars examples (con't)

```Terraform
rds_scaling_configuration = {
  "dev" = {
    rds_auto_pause               = true,
    rds_min_capacity             = 1,
    rds_max_capacity             = 4,
    rds_seconds_until_auto_pause = 300
  },
  "cap" = {
    rds_auto_pause               = false,
    rds_min_capacity             = 2,
    rds_max_capacity             = 64,
    rds_seconds_until_auto_pause = 300
  },
  ...and so on...
```

---

# Outputs

* No outputs from a Terraform project are exposed unless explicitly defined
* They expose values or data returned from resources after apply
* Outputs can be accessed by other configurations via a terraform_remote_state data source, which allows for multi-project integration
* Values can be complex type

---

# Output Examples

```Terraform
output "encryption_key_arn" {
  description = "The ARN of the KMS Key for encryption and decryption of stored data"
  value       = aws_kms_key.encryption.arn
}

output "metadata" {
  description = "All outputs of the the AWS Lambda function"
  value       = aws_lambda_function.function
}
```
